Google Pixel Research Timeline

Week 1 (Due March 4): 
- Creating Timeline
- Learn a little C++ (well versed with C so should not be so hard)
- Reading on WebJack and Previous Work done on utilizing audio jacks for microcontroller use (mostly with Arduino). Watch and thoroughly understand the data being processed by the Google Pixel. 
- Consider different applications/benefits or connecting the ATTiny85 with a repurposed phone.

Week 2 (Due March 11):
- Learn a little C++ (well versed with C so should not be so hard)
- Test ATTiny85 using additional Arduino board
- Do additional research on the ATTiny85, how it works from a logic perspective and push to see the capabilities of ATTiny85 without Arduino. 
Also look at other microntrollers that are small and cheap and may have a chance to work with audio jacks. If there are, bring it up to Professor Oliveira ASAP.
- Do additional research on Google Pixel 3 audio jack, but now exploring why it works for interfacing with Arduinos BUT NOT FOR ATTiny85. (Look through SoftModem GitHub code)
What piece is missing/preventing the process of reading and writing data to Arduino to happen with a cheaper microcontroller. 
Can this be fixed or avoided using code or additional cheap electronics to simulate the process with Arduino and audio Jack
- https://github.com/arms22/SoftModem/issues/5 (forum for trying to connect ATTiny with audio jack).

Week 3 (Due March 18):
- Continue Tests with ATTiny85, which could include testing cheap options to replace an Arduino in Webjack.
- https://github.com/arms22/SoftModem/issues/5 (forum for trying to connect ATTiny with audio jack).
- Find exact differences between Timer0 and Timer1 for ATTiny, why connection to Timer0 has been particularly problematic.
- Look into way to utilize Timer1 instead of Timer0

Week 4 (Due March 25):
- Searching through the code from SoftModem and finding ways to account for the simplicity of ATTiny85. (for example, ATTiny85 has no TX and RX pins that Arduino has).
- Consider whether code changes/lack of Arduino may result in ineffiencies in the data.

Week 5 (Due April 1):
- Extracting the code from SoftModem and finding ways to account for the simplicity of ATTiny85. (for example, ATTiny85 has no TX and RX pins that Arduino has).
- ADC multiplexer possible solution (has other downsides though)
- Continue to look into Timers, find online resources that deal with selection of timers.
- https://github.com/arms22/SoftModem/issues/5 (forum for trying to connect ATTiny with audio jack).

Week 6 (Due April 8):
- Hopefully undergo ADC mux solution
- continue the rest of the bullets from Week 5.



REVISED FINAL TIMELINE

Week 7 (Due April 15):
- Have proof of Webjack/Softmodem working with Arduino Uno first.
- Have an additional circuit of trying to interface with ATTiny85
- Have some kind of attempt of sending data to ATTiny85 from computer.
- Continue to look into Timers, find online resources that deal with selection of timers.

Week 8 (Due April 22):
- Continue with attempts of sending data to ATTiny85 from computer but especially with the Google Pixel 3.
- If that works, attempt to see if the 85 can use a pin to send some kind of data back to the phone or computer.

Week 9 (Due April 29):
- FINAL PRESENTATION
- Have all documentation done by this day.
- Consider some different ways to apply new communication for sensor use. And begin to implement said applications

SoftModem (a wired, low-cost and platform independent solution for communication between an Arduino and mobile phones.)
It uses the phone's audio jack and Bell 202 modem-like FSK encoding with up to 1225 bit/s. Check out this blog post.
