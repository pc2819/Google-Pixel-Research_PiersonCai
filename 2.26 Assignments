Precedent Studies: elements or designs that have been established over a period of time and can serve as a model for new ideas.
- Historical Precedents
- Socio-Political Precedents
- Technological Precedents
- Scientific Precedents
- Artistic/Aesthetic Precents

Precedents are important so you know what has already been researched
- When you publish something you need to explain what research has come before and why your research is different and new

Have two precedents by next week:
- Search online for precedents
    - utilizing microcontrollers with old phones (specifically Google Pixel)
    - Cheap microcontroller applications for the ATTiny for sensors
    - Using phones as hubs for data/audio/signal processing
    - Then adding the part of using cheap microcontrollers for additional uses
- One scientific/technological
- One applied/design/art

- Have a timeline for the research for the semester week by week by next week
    - Mondayâ€™s for milestones (even if we are not meeting)
- Meeting individually next week
