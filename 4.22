Things that Do Work:

- AVR Bootlander with LED
- SoftModem circuit with receiving data from Google Pixel
- No longer errors that occur in Arduino code when uploading using programmer


However, it seems like I changed everything to Timer0, however there seems to be content from Ryan Meiser the creator of SoftModem that seems to sugges that I need to change something in order to use Timer1
on the ATTiny. 
- I am not exactly sure how to do this. 

- For some reason error occurs when using Pin 2 of Tiny85 for LED.


1 hour later...

- The small LED on the ATTiny Bootloader does blink when I send audio data from the Google Pixel. It is clear the Tiny does get something from the Pixel. However, the LED that I define to be connected to a pin does not work.
- This works for both FSK Serial Generator and singular audio clip.
